## Crony: a simple cron runner

Use the `Job` trait to create your cron job struct, pass it to the `Runner`Â and then start it via `run()` method.
Runner will spawn new thread where it will start looping through the jobs and will run their handle
method once the scheduled time is reached.

If your OS has enough threads to spare each job will get its own thread to execute, if not it will be
executed in the same thread as the loop but will hold the loop until the job is finished.

Please look at the [**`Job trait`**](./trait.Job.html) documentation for more information.

### Example
You can run the example using `cargo run --example basic`

```rust
use crony::{Job, Runner, Schedule};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

struct ExampleJob;
impl Job for ExampleJob {
    fn schedule(&self) -> Schedule {
        "1/5 * * * * *".parse().unwrap()
    }
    fn handle(&self) {
        println!("Hello, I am a cron job running at: {}", self.now());
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut runner = Runner::new();

    println!("Adding ExampleJob to the Runner");
    runner = runner.add(Box::new(ExampleJob));

    println!("Starting the Runner for 20 seconds");
    runner = runner.run();
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(20 * 1000));

    println!("Stopping the Runner");
    runner.stop();
}
```

Output:
```
Adding ExampleJob to the Runner
Starting the Runner for 20 seconds
